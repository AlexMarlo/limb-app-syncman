======================== Syncman - painless remote projects synchronization utility ========================

1) Unpack the archive, for example in directory /var/www/syncman

2) Make /var/www/syncman/var directory writable for web server:

$ chmod 777 /var/www/syncman/var

3) Create syncman VirtualHost in Apache config file(httpd.conf), something like this:

<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/syncman/www/
    ServerName syncman
    ErrorLog logs/syncman-error_log
    CustomLog logs/syncman-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

4) Put "syncman" host name into /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1  syncman

5) Restart Apache

6) Open http://syncman in your browser, you should see a couple of test projects

7) All projects settings are stored in "projects" directory of syncman application. You can copy "projects-examples" 
  directory into "projects" directory in order to try some sample projects.
